SquidLook README

Why a new fork of mysar?
------------------------

Mysar is a good work, but I decided to take the sources of Mysar 2.0.12
and to extend it.
SquidLook supports these features missing in Mysar:

  - Period time support in all pages, not only in the main page (monthly view, for example)
  - Groups of users support (for now via Active Directory or file)
  - Whitelisting allows to not include certain sites in the statistics
  - Optimized some SQL queries
  - Privacy support 
  - MySql 5.0 support
